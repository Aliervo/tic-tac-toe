From the Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe).

This project focused on keeping the global scope clean using modules and factory
functions wherever possible.  I attempted to write a more efficient victory checker
function than your standard brute force check, and while I believe I succeeded,
it involves significantly more code and may therefore be the less elegant solution.

The game now works, but due to time constraints and a busy work schedule, will
sadly likely never reach what I would consider a *finished* state.  If I ever
find the time, I would like to:
* Enhance the interface to allow players to add their names and possibly custom
letters/symbols as their marker.
* Add an actual display for the Winner Announcement, instead of just a console
log.
* Implement an the AI I spent so much time refactoring my initial attempt to support.
* Finish the styling to my initial vision of a Tic Tac Toe game made of neon lights,
the current red and black theme doesn't look bad, but it doesn't have the glow
that actual lighting would.
